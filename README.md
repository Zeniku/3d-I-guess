## 3d I guess
I made this because I was interested in coding again
check it out on **https://zeniku.github.io/3d-I-guess**

### Issues
local host gave me an ok frame rate 
the rendering of triangles when it is not inside of the screen works ok in the local host

but the triangles have the reverse results when rendering them in the hosted site 
instead of higher frame rate when zoomed in
it goes lower and vice versa 

### Movement 
movement was only coded via mobile
don't expect movement if you are using pc

### It's a Fork
this is a fork code from spck user speeding-copenhagen70 entitled **3d Render Basic**
