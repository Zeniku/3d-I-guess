## 3d I guess
I made this because I was interested in coding again
check it out on **https://zeniku.github.io/3d-I-guess**

### Update
- added the triangle counterclockwise detection
- improved movement 
- deltaTime

### Issues
- local host gave me an ok frame rate but instead of higher frame rate when zoomed in
it goes lower and vice versa 

### Movement 
movement was only coded via mobile
don't expect movement if you are using pc for now

### It's a Fork
this is a fork code from spck user speeding-copenhagen70 entitled **3d Render Basic**
